# solhexd
This _hexdump_ in C for Solaris10 is an exercise to be more familiar with Solaris 10 development in C, using Solaris Studio and all afferent tools. 

Doing this during a lazy afternoon, full of pancakes and honey is not really efficient. There is a good news: I have some time to think about what's specific to Solaris and I can use in a simple code like this.

## Solaris studio, first impression
It's a Netbeans 8 with a good configuration for using Oracle and GNU compilers or C and Fortran.
